# Installation Guide
This guide describes the steps to install Optim3D using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/optim3d/) or from source.

## Step 1: Install Miniconda
First, you need to install Miniconda, which is a minimal version of Anaconda. You can download Miniconda from the following link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Choose the version that matches your operating system, and follow the instructions to install it on your system.

## Step 2: Install Geoflow-bundle
You need to install **Geoflow-bundle v2022.06.17** to perform the 3D reconstruction of buildings. You can follow the steps of installation in the following link:
https://github.com/geoflow3d/geoflow-bundle

Once Geoflow-bundle is installed, you can go through the next steps.

## Step 3: Create the Conda Environment
Before installing Optim3D, you need to create a Python environment by running the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name optimenv python=3.9
conda activate optimenv
conda install -c conda-forge pdal python-pdal
conda install -c conda-forge entwine
```

This command will create a new Conda environment named <code>optimenv</code>. The environment uses **Python 3.9.13** and have the following packages installed:
- Entwine>=3.1.0
- PDAL>=3.4.5
- Python-PDAL (Python bindings for PDAL)

In case the installation of dependencies using <code>conda</code> is taking too much time, an alternative option is to use <code>Mamba</code> as a package manager. Mamba is a faster and more efficient package manager than Conda, particularly when it comes to installation, updates, and dependency resolution. This is because Mamba is written in C++ and uses multithreading to parallelize operations, whereas Conda is written in Python and does not take advantage of multiple cores as effectively.

Mamba can be used in a similar way to Conda for creating and managing Conda environments:

```bash
conda create --name optimenv python=3.9
conda activate optimenv
conda install mamba -c conda-forge
mamba install pdal python-pdal -c conda-forge
mamba install entwine -c conda-forge
```

## Step 4: Install Optim3D

You can install <code>optim3d</code> in your Conda environment by simply running:

```bash
pip install optim3d
```

Or, you can build it from source:

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository of the Optim3D and navigate to its root directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yarroudh/Optim3D/
cd Optim3D
```

### Install Dependencies
Before installing Optim3D, you should install all the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install Optim3D using the <code>setup.py</code> file.

```bash
pip install .
```

This command will install Optim3D and its dependencies in the Conda environment that you created earlier. These dependencies are :
- click==8.1.8 
- geopandas==1.0.1
- osmnx==2.0.1

### Verify the Installation

Verify that the application is installed correctly by running this command:

```bash
optim3d --help
```

If the command shows you the following message, the application is correctly installed in the Conda environment:

```bash
